## Bio

I am a Great Pyrenees Mountain Dog. I am the most athletic Great Pyrenees you will ever meet. My breed usually sleeps 18 hours a day but I can run with the best of them. I usually go on two walks a day, one 30-40 minute jog every night, and have park zoomies about once a week. In my two years in Florida, I had to really tone down my activity, but now I am back to my old ways in Oregon!
