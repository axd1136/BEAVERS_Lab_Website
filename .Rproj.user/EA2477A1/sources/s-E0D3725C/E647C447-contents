## Bio

Dr. Oldham's research has primarily focused on sport-related concussion and the effect on gait and postural control. She is also interested in the relationship between concussion and subsequent musculoskeletal injury, which is the underlying foundation for my interest in the human startle response. She was recently awarded a Thrasher Research Fund Early Career Award (on which Dr. Bradford serves as a research consultant) titled “A Multifaceted Assessment of Post-Concussion Adolescent Startle Response and Injury” that will examine the acoustic startle reflex in 1) adolescents currently diagnosed with a concussion, 2) adolescents with a concussion history, and 3) healthy controls.
