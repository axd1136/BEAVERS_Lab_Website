## Bio

I'm a calico cat, originally born in Delray Beach, FL but have traveled all the way across the country to Corvallis, OR. I followed this cat to this house one day and next thing you know, I had food, a home and *so* much love!

I was named after the lemur from Avatar: The Last Airbender, one of my human's favorite TV shows. She says I look like him because of my big eyes and ears, but I don't really see it.

I like to sleep during the day and wake my human up at 3am with the zoomies. I'm an energetic and curious lil gal who also loves cuddles and human food :)
