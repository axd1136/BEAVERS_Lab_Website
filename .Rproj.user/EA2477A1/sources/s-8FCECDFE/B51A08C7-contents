## Bio

My name is Dr. Bennito. I am the mascot for the B.E.A.V.E.R.S Lab!

I'm always smiling when I'm participating in open, empirical and reproducible science experiments. That's why I represent this lab :)

Some of my favorite things to do are collect reliable psychophysiology data, look cute, and root for my football team. Go Beavs!
